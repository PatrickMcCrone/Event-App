# Event-App

This is the start of out Web-based Event App! - To be able to run a local server and use this basic app, ensure Node is installed on your machine - If you need to figure out how to install Node, just look it up on Google. It is fairly simple

1. Starting the App
   - To start the app, open a terminal in your IDE
   - Use the built in command "cd" to change directories to the "server" folder
   - Then run the command "npm run dev" to run the API/server code
   - You should get a clear message in the terminal that the server is running on port 5000
2. Using the App
   - Although there isn't much to do with the app yet, you can still query the sample Neon database!
   - To access the app on your browser type "localhost:5000" in the URL bar. You should see a message saying "This is the start of the Event App!"
   - To query the DB for example conferences, type "localhost:5000/conferences" in the URL bar.
   - Querying the DB for conferences should currently spit on the raw JSON data into the browser window. It won't look too pretty...
